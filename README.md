# Code Quests Blog

Welcome to the open-source repository for my personal blog üåê

Built on the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) template for Jekyll, this blog is a glimpse into my coding side quests, and tech explorations.

### Run Locally
  Follow Jekyll's [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to set up your local environment. Then clone the repository and run the following commands to start the server locally
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoseBritto/blog.git

  ```
If you spot issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/JoseBritto/blog/issues/new) or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
