# Code Quests Blog

Welcome to the open-source repository for my personal blog 🌐

Built on the Chirpy template for Jekyll, this blog is a glimpse into my coding side quests, musings, and tech explorations.

- **Chirpy Template:** Explore the features and design in the [Chirpy GitHub repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

- **Run Locally:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-quests-blog.git
   bundle exec jekyll serve
```
If you spot issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/JoseBritto/blog/issues/new) or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!

> [!NOTE]  
> The site is still a work in progress and I'm not sure what to blog about yet.
