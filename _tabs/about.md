Welcome to Code Quests, my digital playground where I try out and discuss completely random things that intrigue
my curiosity. If you are someone who loves to poke stuff and learn how everything works, this is for you.

### Who the hell is this guy?
I'm just a very curious yet relatively inexperienced developer who 
loves to explore anything and everything related to technology and computers.
I also sometimes geek out about optimization strategies and scalability. 
Sometimes I talk about linux, opensource and digital privacy as well.

Reach out to me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@josebritto:matrix.org) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josebrittosaaji/) if you would like a chat &#128522;
